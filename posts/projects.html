        <p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/RonitRay">My GitHub Profile</a></p>

<p>Some of my projects are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/RonitRay/personalwebsite">This site</a>- Clean, minimal homepage and blog with focus on speed and accessibility, and no JavaScript. Generated using a self-coded static site generator.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/RonitRay/ecstatic">Ecstatic, a very basic static site generator written in Python</a>- Also happens to be the tool used to build this site. The project is pretty young, and can be extended infinitely, but I'm already very happy with it and implementing features as I go.</p></li>
</ol>
