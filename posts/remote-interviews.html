    <p>The post <a href="https://dev.jimgrey.net/2021/06/03/nine-tips-for-interviewing-over-zoom/">Nine tips for interviewing over Zoom</a> appeared on HackerNews yesterday. It's a fairly innocuous post, I don't necessarily agree with all the tips but it's fair enough as a personal recommendation. As is the case with HN, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27405951">the discussion around the post</a> proved to be more interesting than the post itself. Hijinks ensued.</p>

<p>There was a somewhat worrying trend in the comments, mostly from recruiters and the like who have significant experience interviewing candidates remotely. Now, this definitely wasn't the only view expressed, but it was repeated enough for me to take note of it. Several commenters suggest using a DSLR as a webcam, others say they would think poorly of (and maybe dismiss entirely) a candidate who had "silly WiFi issues", "poor internet", "bad video", and so on. One apparent recruiter suggested the very common issue of inconsistent or poor internet connectivity must be resolved by "buying the most expensive router, or renting a remote office or a co-working space." </p>

<p>At the end of the day, these insular, privileged opinions coming out of a forum like HN is probably not surprising, but it is a concerning trend, especially if it is shared by recruiters beyond the forum, and if the remote work situation continues in the months and years to come. The category of people who are well-off and looking to switch jobs because they are chasing new challenges or have achieved everything there is to in their present role is significantly different from candidates who have recently been let go, or are fresh out of college, neck-deep in student debt and looking for work as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Class (and race/caste/gender etc.) markers serve as a somewhat valuable signal in the standard recruiting process anyway- ranging from the way someone shows up in an interview and how they are dressed to more controversial things like a person's surname and their perceived socio-economic background. These signals are only amplified by taking the process remote. Suddenly, you lose a number of things that make the footing a little more neutral. You are no longer interviewing on-location at the company, which means you have to account for your space, an internet connection, a video and audio setup, a device setup to actually host the call and so on, in addition to how you dress and present yourself. It places a significantly heavier burden upon the candidate, and the cost of entry can be prohibitive for several job seekers. And that is just the cost of entry. </p>

<p>It is hard to deny that great video and audio and a smooth, uninterrupted call will leave a better impression on the reviewer. Unfortunately, going from "working" to "great" is a major leap. Let's approach this from the only perspective available to me- an Indian one. </p>

<ul>
<li>Less than half of all families in India have access to electricity for more than 12 hours a day. </li>
<li>16% households received 1-8 hours of electricity daily, and 33% received 9-12 hours. 
<ul>
<li>That does not even account for reliability or consistency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only 24% of Indian households have access to a smartphone. </li>
<li>Only 11% have access to a computer, laptop, or tablet. </li>
<li>Only 8% of all households with members aged 5-24 have both a computer and an internet connection. </li>
<li>Among the poorest 20% households, only 2.7% have access to a computer and 8.9% to internet facilities. In case of the top 20% households, the proportions are 27.6% and 50.5%. </li>
<li>Subjects who use home broadband, over 3% face cable cuts, 53% face poor connectivity and 32% face signal issues. </li>
<li>In case of mobile data, 40.2% face poor connectivity and 56.6% face signal issues. </li>
</ul>

<p>These statistics become even more grave, and the disparity even wider if you categorize by gender and caste. You have to be on the good side of each of these figures and more to even make it through the virtual door. And yet...</p>

<p>Let's assume you're privileged enough to own a computer, and have access to decent electricity and internet (each costing several hundred to several thousand rupees every month). It is 2021 and the vast majority of laptops still ship with webcams and microphones that are absolute garbage. "Serviceable" would probably be the most charitable thing you could say about them. Of course, if you own a desktop you will likely need to purchase the enabling gadgets separately anyway. A decent (not great, only decent) 1080p webcam would cost you at least 3000 INR. If you choose to forgo the webcam and <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/droidcam-phone-webcam">use your phone as one</a>, you still need to purchase a tripod or a mount for reliably keeping it level. That's about 500-1000 INR. Also, no one really has a DSLR lying around, but if they did, that would have cost upwards of 30000 INR. A lavalier mic costs about 1000 INR and is just about acceptable, not a huge upgrade over a laptop mic. Taking the step up to a USB condenser mic or a dynamic XLR mic + USB audio interface, pop filter and a boom arm or mount would cost about 5000 INR or more. Add another few hundred (at least) for acceptable lighting, and now you have something close to what these recruiters might call "respectable". A basic 5GHz WiFi router that barely covers a 500-700sqft apartment costs 3000 INR. The costs keep racking up.</p>

<p>Converting these to dollar amounts might make it sound insignificant, and some may argue that it is an investment in your future. Unfortunately, it isn't an investment everyone will be able to make. Solutions are in short supply for structural issues of this nature. Robust public utilities are incredibly hard to establish at scale in a country as large, populous and diverse as India, and they require governments who are actually inclined to do so in the first place. </p>

<p>If the problem has to be addressed at an individual level, we have already lost. As a recruiter, however, you still have some power over the situation. Here are some requests for you to mull over:</p>

<ol>
<li>Conduct interviews over voice if video is not absolutely necessary. Audio interviews can be conducted over phone or any standard meeting application, but have the advantage of requiring much less bandwidth, meaning the interview is likely to proceed with fewer hitches and drops. You could also ask the candidate to turn on video for the parts of the interview where it is needed but conduct the bulk of it on voice.</li>
<li>Try to ignore extraneous signals like video quality or other disturbances on their end. Not everyone has the luxury of a dedicated space that they can set up to take calls.</li>
<li>Clear communication from your end as well as that of the candidate is a must, so you can set up a specific time window for the interview and adhere to it. It is not uncommon for an applicant to line up a host of interviews and appointments as closely together as possible to maximize their chances of landing a job. While it may come off as rude if they are looking hurried and need to jump off the call, it is important to recognize that, for many, this is a compulsion.</li>
<li>If you do recruit someone to work remotely for the foreseeable future, do what you can to make it possible for them. I believe it is standard practice (for medium to large companies at least) to provide a device (like a laptop) for remote work. If not, you need to at least set up a workstation that they can connect to remotely through a VPN from their own devices or thin clients. At the very least, they need to be compensated enough to be able to afford at least the operating costs (electricity, networking etc) and if possible, a separate work device as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>For job applicants in a position to do something about it, I would suggest gradually working towards establishing a setup that works for you, as I am doing the same. I recognize that I have the privilege (at least for now) to be able to work remotely and be productive enough in this modality that I can actually still prefer it when it isn't a mandate. </p>
