## What is Ecstatic?

Ecstatic is a static site generator. It is a python program that makes use of, primarily, the jinja2 template engine to generate a complete website. It is ideal for blogs and/or personal/company websites.

<div id='installing'>

## Installing

Note: You need to have python installed on your system to use ecstatic. It has been built using Python 3+, and not tested on 2.x. It may work, but please don't expect support on deprecated versions.

Once you have installed python on your system, go ahead and clone the git repo.

<div class='codeblock'>
<pre>
<code>
$ git clone https://github.com/RonitRay/ecstatic.git
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This downloads the generator as well as some boilerplate templates and sample files to get you started right away.</p>

<p>Before you start, there are some python dependencies you must install. I recommend using a virtual environment or <code>pipenv</code> within the ecstatic folder for containerization and to not affect your system in any way.</p>

<div class='codeblock'>
<pre>
<code>
$ pipenv shell
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class='codeblock'>
<pre>
<code>
$ pip3 install datetime jinja2 markdown2
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>You should now be all set.</p>

<p></div></p>

## Folder Structure

The basic principle for operation is:

- The ```drafts``` folder is for all posts you are working on but don't want to publish yet, written in ```markdown (.md)``` format. 
- The ```content``` folder consists of all your finished blog posts or content pages. Remember to move your markdown file from drafts to content if you want to publish it.
- The ```templates``` folder allows you to create templates in HTML with some python logic as per the jinja2 specification.
- The ```output``` folder will consist of the generated site, as well as any CSS or images that you would like to have on the site.

</div>

<div id='understanding-templates'>

## Understanding Templates

Templates are a kind of skeleton that define how any page of a particular type (eg. home, article etc) is to be structured.

Templates in jinja2 exist to extend static HTML and provide scope for content to be dynamically inserted into placeholder 'blocks' using Python logic.
