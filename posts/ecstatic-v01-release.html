        <p>Today I am formally releasing v0.1 of Ecstatic, a static site generator that I wrote in Python using the Jinja template engine.</p>

<p>This generator was initially intended only to generate this blog, but I think I've been able to make it generic enough to be extensible.</p>

<li><a href="https://ronitray.neocities.org/posts/ecstatic-documentation.html">Documentation</a></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Please note that this is a point release and is still very much a minimal and raw project. I definitely recommend getting your hands dirty with it, but you should think twice before deploying it in a production environment where things move quickly and break fast.</em></p>
