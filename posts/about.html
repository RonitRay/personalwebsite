        <p>Hi there! If you're looking for something more formal, you can <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/resume.html">find my résumé here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm Ronit Ray, a web developer based in Kolkata, India. </p>

<p><img src="https://ronitray.xyz/img/profile.jpeg" alt="A not-great but serviceable picture of me, Ronit Ray"/></p>

<p>I currently work as an Assistant Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services. I've spent the last couple of years working on REST web services in Java+Spring along with an Oracle DB backend. I'm now picking up Angular and enjoying every bit.</p>

<p>My interests are varied- I read a lot, practically anything I can lay my hands on. I love watching video essays and documentaries, but don't shy away from guilty pleasures like poorly written action flicks either. 
I believe there must be more to life than personal enrichment, and value equality, privacy, shared knowledge, and human relationships.</p>

<p>I'm always on the lookout for any opportunity to widen my horizons. If you would like to reach out, please feel free to <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
