<h3>What is this page?</h3>
<p>I'm going to use this page as a stand-in for my goodreads profile, because I'd like to have all my data in one place, and I'm also not really fond of the idea of doing Amazon's work for free. <a href='https://macwright.com/2017/12/11/indieweb-reading.html'>Mac Wright's 2017 post</a> is an inspiration as well.
</p>
<p>These are some books I've read in the last 6-8 years, along with my rating at the time of finishing each one. Some of them might show up as links if I add a review or copy one over from my Goodreads profile.</p>
