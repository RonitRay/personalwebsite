<title>Getting Your Feet (and mine) Wet in the World of Sports Analytics</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/sports-analytics-starter.html</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021</pubDate>
<description>A list of resources for data analytics and visualization, specifically in the sports world thanks to Tom Worville and a number of awesome people on Twitter.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><small>
Personal note: I love football. I didn't get into the game very early in my life, but since age 12 or so, I have been absolutely obsessed. Earlier this year, I got a subscription to <a href="https://theathletic.com/">The Athletic</a> and was exposed to some of the best football coverage I've ever read. While I cannot afford the subscription anymore, I still have access to a lot of their content through podcasts and partner YouTube channels like the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TifoFootball">Tifo Football</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TifoIRL">Tifo IRL</a>. Tom Worville, their data analytics writer, has consistently put out superb work that is informative and interesting. More recently, he has featured in a series of videos by Tifo, comparing players in Europe's top leagues across several dimensions using scattergrams.</p>

<p>Very recently, Tom has signed as a Data Scientist for RB Leipzig, one of the hottest projects in Europe (Congratulations, Tom!). I think it's fair to say his work has impressed me and maybe even inspired me to dip my toes in the field. Thankfully, Worville himself and a number of awesome people on Twitter have compiled more resources than I can get through in quite some time. This post is an attempt to document the same. 99% of the effort is from the people who actually created the materials and compiled them. All I have done is removed Twitter's stupid tracking links and cleaned up the formatting a little so it's actually readable. I will hopefully be visiting some of these materials in the future and writing about what I learn from them.

<h2>Thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall">@tylermorganwall</a></h2>

<p>Reminder: there are hundreds of great, FREE learning resources for <code>#rstats</code> out there. There's no need to sign up to take courses with a disgusting, ethically bankrupt company with sniveling, feckless leadership.</p>

<p>I'm completely self-taught in R. Here's a list of the FREE, OPEN materials I've used on my journey: For data wrangling and visualization, nothing beats <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">Hadley's "R for Data Science"</a></p>

<p>Want to learn about data visualization? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/ClausWilke">@ClausWilke</a>'s <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">"Fundamentals of Data Visualization"</a>. While not a book about R specifically, it's a great resource for learning what makes a good, interpretable viz. Plus, the book's code is available!</p>

<p>If you want to learn about ggplot2 plotting in particular, it's best to get it straight from the source: read Hadley's ggplot2: <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/">Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis</a>. I can't imagine why you'd want to learn it from anyone else.</p>

<p>For diving into the internals of R, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz">Hadley's "Advanced R"</a> is a wonderful resource. I've gone back to it several times over the years and found new nuggets of info. Confused about environments or closures, or how to debug C code or NSE? Check it out. The second edition of "Advanced R" is available at a <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz">slightly different URL</a></p>

<p>Want to learn about maps, GIS, and spatial analysis and visualization? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/robinlovelace">@robinlovelace</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/jakub_nowosad">@jakub_nowosad</a>'s <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">"Geocomputation with R"</a>, a great free resource on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.</p>

<p>Want to learn how to spin up your own data analysis cluster and do work on "big data" in R? Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/javierluraschi">@javierluraschi</a>'s <a href="https://therinspark.com/">"Mastering Spark with R."</a> He even shows you how to fire up a rayrender render farm for complex 3D visualizations! </p>

<p>If you like the "in person" learning experience video provides and you're interested in learning more about making maps in R with rayshader, check out my open and free masterclass I taught with the <a href="https://twitter.com/PennMUSA">@PennMUSA</a> program: </p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/tylermorganwall/MusaMasterclass">Code</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the R community is the best—if you ever run into seemingly intractable problems on your journey, tweet your issue with the <code>#rstats</code> hashtag &amp; almost certainly you'll get help. And if that fails, try the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">community forums hosted by RStudio</a></p>

<p>I'd add <a href="https://socviz.co/">Kieran Healy's Data Visualization</a>, available in a free online format as well as a textbook.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://rfordatasci.com">awesome Slack group</a> to help work through the book (and help on all other R questions as well). People are really helpful and friendly!</p>

<p>Learn about solve text mining problems with <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">"Text Mining with R"</a>! Great introduction to the tidytext package and working with text data by <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge">@juliasilge</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">@drob</a></p>

<title>Turn Substack articles into distraction-free blog posts in 60 seconds</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/clean-substack.html</link>
<pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021</pubDate>
<description>Substack is nice and all, but I like a clean reading experience. Here's how you can get the best of both worlds.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Substack seems to be the new hotness for a variety of established as well as enthusiast writers and bloggers, and I understand the appeal. They seem to provide a fairly good monetization plan and have an easy enough process for even less technical people to get started.</p>

<p>I have no interest in moving to Substack and have not bothered creating an account either. My experience with the site comes from having authors' Substack links show up on HN or Reddit feeds. My understanding is authors have granular control over whether they want to put their entire body of work or just the latest N posts behind a paywall or at least a subscription. Substack's entire business model revolves around these subscriptions. As a result, on the vast majority of Substack pages, there are several calls to action carefully strewn to get you to subscribe. Some of these calls to action are:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the header</li>
<li>After a couple of paragraphs of text in the post</li>
<li>After a few more paragraphs of text</li>
<li>Popups</li>
<li>At the end of the article</li>
<li>After the comments and before the footer</li>
</ol>

<p>and so on. </p>

<p>These are not as egregious as some news sites, or as irritating as the antipatterns found on Medium.com. It also seems like Substack give authors some modicum of control over which, if any, of these that they want to display on their content, because not every Substack based site I have come across has all of them. It doesn't change two fundamental things about me, however:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I view a webpage, I want the content and nothing more. I want to be off the site when I am done.</li>
<li>I am unlikely to subscribe to random Substack pages, and even if I were to, I would prefer using RSS and not their mechanism. I have enough tech smarts and agency to do that without having to be nagged repeatedly.</li>
</ol>

<p>If both of these apply to you as well, or if you came across <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/stackoverflow-faster">my post on cleaning up the average StackOverflow page</a> and are interested in applying these principles to other websites, you've come to the right place.</p>

<p>I have come up with a uBlock Origin cosmetic filter list that should do away with most random intrusive content on Substack pages and leave only the content you came for. The below steps assume you are using a supported browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Chromium derivatives like Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera), and have installed uBlock Origin already.</p>

<ol>
<li>After installing uBlock, click on the settings icon <img src='https://ronitray.xyz/img/ublock_settings.png' alt='The icon for settings in uBlock Origin'></li>
<li>In the tab that opens, click on My Filters on the top bar.</li>
<li>Add the following lines to the text box:
<pre class='codeblock'>! 2021-07-27 https://substack.com
substack.com###nojs-banner
substack.com##.subscribe-btn.subscribe-cta.primary.button
substack.com##.notification-container.menu-button.button &gt; svg
substack.com##.footer
substack.com##.subscribe-footer
substack.com##div.single-post-section:nth-of-type(3)
substack.com##div.single-post-section:nth-of-type(2)
substack.com##.page-nav
substack.com##[href^="/subscribe"] &gt; .subscribe-btn.primary.button
substack.com##td.icon.post-meta-item:nth-of-type(1)
substack.com##div.subscribe-widget:nth-of-type(3)
substack.com##div.subscribe-widget &gt; .form &gt; .sideBySideWrap &gt; input
substack.com##div.subscribe-widget &gt; .form &gt; .sideBySideWrap
substack.com##td.icon.post-meta-item:nth-of-type(2)
substack.com##td.icon.post-meta-item:nth-of-type(3)
</pre></li>
<li>Click on 'Apply Changes', close the tab and try opening any Substack page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome to clean textual goodness, the way God intended it.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>This isn't some kind of hack that suddenly enables you to bypass paywalls and view restricted content for free. It only cleans up pages that are already available to you.</li>
<li>These rules apply only to Substack.com and author.substack.com kind of subdomains. However, a number of authors use Substack on their custom domains, so you might need to add these rules to your filter list again, substituting substack.com for the relevant domain.</li>
<li>Since Substack's business model is directly tied to subscriptions you make on the platform, these steps could be construed as attacking their income. And honestly, I'm fine with that. If I come across a writer whose work I am inclined to support, I will go out of my way to seek appropriate channels to do that. And Substack can forget about my money as long as they keep platforming and making money from the likes of Graham Linehan.</li>
</ol>

<description>More updates from my pointless life.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course I fall off a bandwagon the second after I start it. RIP Weekly Digests, here's to more sporadic updates, I guess. Personally, things have not been great, but I'm not going to be writing about that. Here's literally everything else that is keeping me sane.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>I took some time off my read of Don Quixote to join a read-along of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_%26_the_Olympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a> series with a group of friends. This is probably my third read-through and I am honestly amazed by how fresh the writing still feels. I have absolutely no problems professing my love for this series and Riordan's subsequent work. It's a huge mood lifter. We are two weeks and two books in at this point, and having more fun than ever.</p>

<p>About the gentleman from La Mancha, it's... fine? I am admittedly not too far in, but it seems an easy enough read considering the work is 400 years old at this point. I guess the Edith Grossman translation is very approachable. That said, the book has yet to grow on me. It's pretty funny, no doubt, but I do feel it is trying a bit hard at this point. I have not written it off yet, and fully intend to return to it soon.</p>

<h3>Movies</h3>

<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suicide_Squad_(film)">The Suicide Squad</a> this week, and it was spectacular. The movie has style, humor, action, heart, and hilariously over-the-top gore and silliness. I'm absolutely delighted by it, and happy for James Gunn. It is an upgrade in every way over the atrocity that was the previous movie, and honestly just good. Hopefully the positive reception it gets sends the right messages to WB: stop making your comic book movies ridiculously dark and dreary, and don't interfere with the people who know what they're doing.</p>

<p>I also watched the first episode of Marvel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...%3F_(TV_series)">What If?</a> series on Disney+, and was left underwhelmed and seriously disappointed by it. The animation was wooden and unenjoyable, the plot could have been much, much wilder but chose to be a rehash of a movie everyone had already seen, with a couple of switcharoos thrown in for fun, and all the chances for character development even within the reduced scope of the plot thrown out due to self-imposed time constraints. I have very, very low expectations for the rest of this series if it is destined to be more of the same. In achieving one of Disney's primary goals of selling a ton of toys, I have no doubt it will fare well. However, the entire venture feels rather lazy to me at this point, especially coming off the wonderful Loki series.</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMLFMsIVis">How We Fix the Climate</a>- Hank Green, vlogbrothers</strong> : I am rather fond of the Green brothers and everything they do. For a channel that is many things at many times, vlogbrothers is a gift that keeps on giving. I enjoyed Hank going deeper into economics this week, it really is a rather good video on the different measures that can be implemented to fend off, and hopefully avert the climate crisis.</p>

<p>I've also mostly been watching videos from a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/answerinprogress">Answer in Progress</a> this week. I think the format is interesting, the 3 hosts are pretty great, and the range of topics covered is very good too. There's no doubt that 10-15 minute videos are hardly deep dives, but they can be solid jumping-off points to start a conversation or get you interested in topics you didn't know you would like... and they're just fun. Here are some of my favorites:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2yvo_hvxDM">Is Fancy Food Accessible?</a></strong> : Which goes into how we define "fancy" food, and how class divides and power dynamics can affect societal perceptions about what things are "posh", "gourmet", and so on. Food, no pun, for thought.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=181Nj060xMQ">i taught an AI to solve the trolley problem</a></strong> : A fun ride throughout and just a tiny taste of AI ethics and how silly the machines and software we trust and will continue to trust several aspects of our lives can be. I know us STEMfolk should probably exercise a bit more scientific rigor, but (a) garbage in garbage out is a thing, (b) data modeling is a damn hard thing to do, especially for complex problems, and (c) goddamn I will not apologize for having fun.</p>

<title>Fix the Dock on PopOS for Productivity and Profit</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/popos-dock-changes.html</link>
<pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021</pubDate>
<description>PopOS is a superb distro, but the new dock could do with some changes. Here's how.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years on KDE and then a variety of minimal window managers, I installed <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">System76's PopOS</a> on my personal laptop a few months ago. GNOME has, historically, really not been my thing, but I've come to really appreciate the way Pop does things.</p>

<p>In many ways Pop has provided a very sane, quick set of defaults that gets out of my way and doesn't need me to tweak much to get started and go about my work. The new <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/655369428109869056/popos-2104-a-release-of-cosmic-proportions">COSMIC desktop</a>, which is what they call their collection of tweaks on top of GNOME, brings quite a few usability improvements. One of these is the <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-dock/">Cosmic Dock</a>, which seems to be some kind of fork of the GNOME extension <a href="https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock">Dash to Dock</a>.</p>

<p>This is pretty cool for laptop users who don't always want to be using keyboard shortcuts to open up applications or switch between them. Using my thumb to navigate while typing with my fingers has been pretty good for me. That said, the default behaviour of the dock is a bit unnatural to me: you can't click on an icon to minimize the window, and if you have multiple instances of the program open, you click on the icon to cycle through the open instances. I would like this to bring up a preview and let me pick which instance to go to directly, which is what panels on KDE and the like usually do.</p>

<p>Turns out this is fully possible, with a little tinkering under the hood. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install dconf-editor from apt or your package manager</li>
<li>In dconf-editor
<ol>
<li>Navigate to 'org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock'</li>
<li>Set the "click-action" to "minimize-or-previews". This does:
<ol>
<li>Single app in background, focus it.</li>
<li>Multiple apps in background, show the previews so you can pick the app you want.</li>
<li>App already focused, minimize it.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>This works about as well as I want it to now. Thanks to Nathanael Anderson for providing <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-dock/issues/21">the solution</a> on GitHub.</p>

<title>Weekly Digest: Jul 26 - Aug 01, 2021</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/digest-jul2021-week4.html</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021</pubDate>
<description>List of interesting links I read this week</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So my plan for this blog was to write (on average at least) one post a week for an entire year to just see if I could, and maybe to polish out my writing. We're about 30 weeks into the year and I have only about 21 posts written, so it's fair to say that cat isn't getting back in the bag anytime soon.</p>

<p>And so, for the purpose of stat-padding, or, in a more charitable sense, writing without much original thought, I'm thinking of putting up a weekly "digest" of content I enjoyed across the internet and sporadically outside of it. Here goes nothing.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>I finished Alexandria Bellefleur's <strong>Written in the Stars</strong> this week, a suggestion from <a href="https://www.npr.org/lifekit">NPR's Life Kit</a> podcast. I haven't read a "romance" book that was solely "romance" in a long, long time, so this was a refreshing change of pace. About 10% into the book, I wasn't enjoying it very much because I genuinely didn't like either of the main characters. The writing as well as the characterization steadily improved, though, and I quite enjoyed the ride. It was pretty vanilla as things go, and played almost everything by the book, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing at all. I did feel like they rushed the end way too much, but that's alright. A fun read when you're all blocked up. 3.5/5.</p>

<p>Up next, I'm tackling the formidable <strong>Don Quixote</strong> (or rather <em>The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha</em>) by Miguel de Cervantes. It's absolutely massive and I'm not sure if it's my thing or whether I can even digest something of its size at this moment, but I feel like the only way to tackle it that would do it justice is to dive head-first into it, throwing caution to the wind.</p>

A disgusting, scummy hive of misinformation and among the absolute worst that capitalism has to offer.

<title>Building a Sustainable Personal Wiki for Free</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/personal-wiki.html</link>
<pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021</pubDate>
<description>I like the idea of a personal wiki, but everything is expensive, over-engineered, or likely to disappear within 5 years. Here's how I navigate through this.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Order is beautiful. My mind is an absolute mess, and the idea of offloading some of it into a structured place that I may never revisit, but can if I want to, is extremely appealing to me at the moment. I've also greatly been inspired by incredible public archives like <a href="https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/">Nikita Voloboev's</a> and <a href="https://rasulkireev.com/brain/">Rasul Kireev's</a>. I think they're incredible and would very much like to build a personal repository that will outlive me and might bring value to someone after I'm gone. This is why I've been thinking about having a knowledge base/personal wiki for a while.</p>

<p>Personal wikis aren't exactly new, they've been around for as long as the web has, if not longer. However, my understanding is that fancy new tools like Notion, Roam, Obsidian etc. have caused a giant uptick in adoption for this habit over the last couple of years. It's hard to navigate YouTube without finding productivity channels talking about their "life OS" or "second brain" built on top of Notion nowadays. And I'm all for it.</p>

<h3>I don't want to use Notion, though.</h3>

<p>It's not that it isn't good, it's pretty great and people who call it a glorified text editor will have to jump through many hoops to name something that brings in the stuff that Notion does on top of basic Markdown. That said, I don't need most of those things, <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/notes-workflow">plain text is perfectly good for me</a>. </p>

<p>Notion is free for personal use now, pretty good looking, easy to use, extensible, and all the other things their marketing department and army of promoters can tell you. That said, I just don't feel like it is for me. <a href="https://www.notion.so/Terms-and-Privacy-28ffdd083dc3473e9c2da6ec011b58ac">Their TOS and Privacy Policy</a> are pretty transparent about the fact that privacy isn't exactly their priority. That's fine, it's their prerogative to prioritize functionality and the ability to make the platform free for so many users. It's just a trade-off I am not willing to make. </p>

<p>Further, because Notion adds a whole lot of functionality over basic text or rich(er) text like Markdown, it's all too easy to get tied down and locked into the platform. To their credit, they allow <a href="https://www.notion.so/Back-up-your-data-1a8eb5bdfce34d19a6360fd015c0075f">export to HTML, Markdown, or PDF</a>, but you would lose out on the fancy bits that aren't directly compatible. You could just not use them and maintain a discipline to treat it as just a plaintext platform, but it's not easy to resist the charm, especially when it may actually be easier to use some of it than have to work around the limitations of just text files. </p>

<p>The other problem here is that it seems their export functionality doesn't work very well. As seen in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27612894">this HN post</a> and the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27613632">follow-up from Notion's CEO</a>, their export feature doesn't work at scale. And a personal wiki is likely to scale pretty quickly if you're diligently adding entries to it over a few years. I don't want to be locked in. I don't want to be reliant on a completely online service to have to do something as simple as writing. And I don't want to have to trust some random company to store my data or to <em>not</em> do something not to my taste or outright malicious with it.</p>

<p>So where do I go?</p>

<h3>My requirements</h3>

<p>I'm not very picky, but here's what I need.</p>

<ol>
<li>Free (libre), as in beer: I'm not above paying for something that brings great utility to my life and work, but I'm strapped for cash at the moment, and I would much rather use something that provides 90% of the utility for free than something else which offers spit and polish and marginal extra utility for a subscription or a lump sum price.</li>
<li>Preferably free, as in freedom: I like free software. I like what it stands for, I like what it can be and I like what the world could be if it was the default. I may not be qualified or interested in reading, understanding, and auditing the code for every FOSS tool that I use, but the social contract of the dev putting it out in the open, and the prospect of a community of which at least a subset might actually be both interested and capable of doing this means, at least in my opinion, that free software will always be superior to proprietary competitors. </li>
<li>Plain text or Markdown support: Plain text stands the test of time. A whole lot of things could render your personal wiki inaccessible or unusable, but Unicode or ASCII going out of fashion or support is highly unlikely, or at least unlikely enough to be a gamble I am willing to take. Even if the tool of choice for viewing, editing, and searching the wiki goes out of support or disappears off the face of the earth, I can read, edit, understand and manipulate plain text just fine.</li>
<li>Sustainable: I should be controlling the data. This boils down to me having access to the files upon which the wiki is built. I should be able to back up, transfer, delete or do whatever I want with these files freely.</li>
<li>Relatively frictionless: I'm just going to be using it less and less if it's slow to start up or involves navigating a bunch of menus every time I have to capture a simple idea. </li>
<li>Preferably cross-platform or easily shareable: I want to be able to edit or at least view the wiki from my phone, or share a relevant page with someone easily.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this isn't too much to ask for. I've basically been doing this with a folder structure and markdown files for personal notes anyway, but elevating that to a Wiki might take just a little more work.</p>

<h3>My Options</h3>

<p>Let's review some of the popular options in the wikispace and see how they fare against my metrics.</p>

<h4>Notion (3/6)</h4>

<p>Notion isn't really a dedicated personal wiki tool, but it very much finds application there. It actually fared better than I expected. Notion is pretty frictionless (once you get past the trap of continuously optimizing your templates for MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY(TM)). It is a web app, so works on anything that is relatively modern. It is now free for personal use, but wasn't always, and there aren't any guarantees that it is always going to be. I've already decided against it so there isn't much more to talk about here.</p>

<p><a href="https://notion.so">Check out Notion here!</a></p>

<h4>Obsidian (3.5 to 5/6)</h4>

<p>Obsidian is probably really close to what I want because it is a dedicated knowledge base tool. It's great for privacy and control because it works on a local folder of Markdown files. It has some really beautiful power features and it allows for networked/linked visualization that is attractive and probably very useful too. It is cross-platform, and free for personal use without any major caveats. However, it is proprietary software, and costs $8/month/site, soon to become $16/month/site to publish your wiki to the web. Still pretty darn fantastic, I would say.</p>

<p><img src="../img/obsidian.webp" alt="Screenshot of an Obsidian screen">

<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Check out Obsidian here!</a></p>

<h4>MediaWiki (4/6)</h4>

<p>MediaWiki is an incredibly robust piece of software, but it really isn't targeted at projects of a scale as small as my personal wiki. Everything about it screams the fact that it is aiming for large Wikipedia or project wiki style projects, with collaboration and many other great features. It is  completely free software released under GPLv2 and is designed to run on a server I own and maintain myself, so sustainability is a check mark too. My main issues with it are:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's super over-engineered for what I need. I don't need (yet) or want to use a local web server or VPS (it's not really free of cost then, is it?). I don't think my wiki will be of the scale that it will ever need to run on a database.</li>
<li>I'd have to learn their markup which is fine and would probably pay off if I stuck to it, but again it adds to friction.</li>
<li>While the end product is somewhat viewable on any web browser, it is a far cry from responsive. <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Mobiles,_tablets_and_responsive_design">Their own wiki</a> states that it is not at all optimized for mobile, but there are some workarounds that can make the experience a little more pleasant.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../img/mediawiki.webp" alt="Screenshot of the MediaWiki homepage"> </p>

<p>I just don't think it's a good fit for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Check out MediaWiki here!</a></p>

<h4>TiddlyWiki (4.5/6)</h4>

<p>TiddlyWiki is fantastic. At first glance it ticks every box and should be the only thing I consider, and yet... very few things have boggled my mind as much as trying to understand it. It was incredibly overwhelming to wrap my head around it, and honestly I want something that gets out of my way rather than needing me to understand its intricacies and idiosyncrasies for a long time before getting any value out of it. Still, the scope of things that seem achievable with it is incredible, and it does seem to be capable of a perfect score if I toughen up and just get past the learning curve. It's a no, but only for now. We may yet have a wonderful time together.</p>

<h4>Wiki.js (4.5/6)</h4>

<p>It's about the same as MediaWiki in terms of metrics...Please don't make me have to maintain a database and a container and an application and a server/VPS for a pet project just yet.</p>

<p><img src="../img/wikijs.webp" alt="Screenshot of a Wiki.js page"></p>

<p><a href="https://js.wiki/">Check out Wiki.js here!</a></p>

<h4>GitBook (4.25/6)</h4>

<p>GitBook is a SaaS. I'm not too keen on using something that can change the ToS on me. It's still good that it is based on markdown files that are super easy to shift elsewhere, but it's not exactly ideal to be at their mercy. At least with an executable you can use it as long as you have it, or downgrade to an old version if they introduce malicious elements or anti-features. Still, GitBook is one of the prettiest solutions I've seen, and I won't lie and say I'm not tempted.</p>

<p><img src="../img/gitbook.webp" alt="Screenshot of a GitBook page"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">Check out GitBook here!</a></p>

<h4>XWiki (5/6)</h4>

<p>Again, very good but not for me. Hosting, database, so on and so forth. XWiki is Java based too, which is a language and platform I am fairly comfortable with. But I'll give it a miss for now.</p>

<p><img src="../img/xwiki.webp" alt="Screenshot of an XWiki page"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome">Check out XWiki here!</a></p>

<h4>DokuWiki (5/6)</h4>

<p>This is another piece of software that really, really impressed me. Short of the fact that I don't want to self-host, it demolishes all of my criteria with flying colours. It's simple and seemingly great to use and navigate around. I had a great feeling reading their docs and can confidently say that if my present solution is ever inadequate and I find myself moving to a hosted solution, DokuWiki will most likely be at the top of my list of options to switch to, even ahead of TiddlyWiki due to sheer simplicity. Easily the best candidate so far, but I'm tempted to explore a little bit more before I consider coughing up the money for a cheap VPS.</p>

<p><img src="../img/dokuwiki.webp" alt="Screenshot of a DokuWiki page"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">Check out Dokuwiki here!</a></p>

<h4>Docusaurus and other static site generator-based solutions (5.5/6)</h4>

<p>Docusaurus is a static site generator based on React, geared to churn out documentation-style webpages quickly. It's pretty good, I've toyed with it at work, but even the few commands here and there add to the friction for me. You can find documentation-style templates for any static generator of your choice. My own site is on a static site generator, and for the few posts a month I think it's perfectly fine. But I expect to use and update my wiki more than that. Still, very solid.</p>

<p><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/jekyll-documentation-themes">Check out Jekyll documentation templates here!</a></p>

<h4>Org-Mode (5/6)</h4>

<p>I'm not an emacs user. That alone is disqualifying for org mode, I think. I have been exposed to some great demonstrations on org-mode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM">1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_-TaEGa7Y">2</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4">3</a>, so I have no illusions about the fact that it is an incredible tool. I actually spent a couple of months in emacs too, and enjoyed it. Part of this period was spent moving over my small notes database (poor choice of words, it was basically a bunch of text files) to org mode. While I enjoyed it, there was too much of it that I felt I didn't understand and had to memorize, and a whole lot of untapped potential as is the case with emacs in general. I've never been exposed to Lisp, and don't have the time or, at the moment, the inclination to learn elisp to get things to work the way I want. For this reason I almost gave negative points to org mode in terms of "friction", but settled on a 0. In another life, or perhaps in a few years... who knows.</p>

<p><img src="../img/orgmode.webp" alt="A screenshot of org-wiki for org-mode in Emacs"></p>

<p><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Check out Org-Mode here!</a></p>

<h4>VimWiki (4/6)</h4>

<p>VimWiki is a newer project that aims to bring some of the org-mode like functionality to Vim, and it's pretty good. I'm much more comfortable with vim, so I considered this seriously for a while. There are some issues, though.</p>

<ol>
<li>The markup is kind of messed up. I'd have to learn it and use it for wiki entries while simultaneously using Markdown for writing posts on my site for example.</li>
<li>The file structure sucks. At least when I used it, no matter the level of nesting of a particular document, everything was dumped in the root folder. Doesn't bode well if I have to move away from VimWiki in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>It does have an (albeit rudimentary) export to HTML feature, which is not bad for shareability. But I was left underwhelmed by it.</p>

<p><img src="../img/vimwiki.webp" alt="A screenshot of VimWiki"></p>

<p><a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">Check out VimWiki here!</a></p>

<h4>Zim (6/6) WINNER WINNER!</h4>

<p>I did it, I found it! And it is beautiful.</p>

<p>My first exposure to Zim was a few years ago in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFeW4Cj5k1s">Average Linux User's video about note-taking programs on Linux</a>. At the time it was a little at loggerheads with what I was looking for; I still maintain a different notes workflow because I want the private stuff to be encrypted and synced but not using a SaaS, and preferably not over the internet at all. However, it seems absolutely perfect for my wiki requirement.</p>

<p><img src="../img/zim.webp" alt="A Zim wiki demo image"></p>

<p>Zim is a remarkable little graphical editor that allows for hierarchical text/hybrid document storage. It's available on every major desktop platform, looks fair enough and is easy to get into. Even beyond the surface simplicity that is so attractive, there's a good deal of features that "power users" might want to make use of from time to time. </p>

<p><a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Show some love for Zim here.</a></p>

<p>What I love:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's just simple.</li>
<li>The WYSIWYG editor is pretty great, but it also supports Markdown and standard keybindings for bold, underline etc.</li>
<li>The folder and file structure is sane.</li>
<li>It isn't usable directly on phone, but there's nothing stopping me from syncing the folder using Syncthing and then editing the files using an editor of my choice.</li>
<li>HTML export is there and it works great! It's pretty quick and simple, and while the default formatting is not responsive, it supports external templates. There are a <a href="https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-wiki/wiki/Templates">handful of templates available already</a>. I've decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/jrm4/Eight-Five-Zero">Eight-Five-Zero</a> theme, but have removed useless (according to me) jQuery stuff, added a CSS rule to make code blocks play well with smaller screens, and fixed an issue with line height that I explained in some detail in <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/line-height-units-css">this post</a>.
<ol>
<li>Yes, the templating language is really simple, and you can just wrap it with good old HTML! <a href="https://github.com/RonitRay/Zim-Wiki-Template-850">Here's a link to my template</a></li>
<li>Zim goes so far as to generate an index for all my content, which is just wonderful.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>What I don't love:</p>

<p>What's not to love? Zim is superb and everything I asked, and potentially could ever ask for. The only thing I can think might be a shortcoming compared to other items listed here is the fact that the web output cannot be searched, but the caveat is that it is served as static HTML that is simpler and much faster. I think I can take that deal. Besides, the actual tool has full-text search in it, it's just the web output which doesn't.</p>

<h3>The Result</h3>

<p>I'm pleased to announce that I've started my wiki on Zim, and I'm really delighted so far. It works great for my use case. </p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.ronitray.xyz/">My Personal Wiki!!</a></p>

<p><img src="../img/wikiscreen.webp" alt="Screenshot of my wiki index."></p>

<p>It's pretty scanty now, but I'm hoping to make good use of it in the days and years to come. Overall, I'm really pleased with my workflow and the result.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

<p>It's still early days, so I don't know if maintaining an extensive and well-documented wiki is something that I will take to. That said, I'm rather excited about it. I've been very pleasantly surprised with the variety of options available to me. If one thing has impressed me so far in my search, it is how many of these are free and open-source. It's a solid refutation of the narrative that you need proprietary or commercial tools to get a job done well, and gives me a lot of hope. I am taking away this hope along with the confidence that I have no dearth of options to switch to if the present arrangement doesn't work out, and the expectation to be able to build the discipline and make something that is not just useful to me, but might also serve as a long-lasting repository of conventional and unconventional knowledge, available to anyone willing to seek it out. Until next time!</p>

<title>Supercharging StackOverflow for Productivity (and Profit?)</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/stackoverflow-faster.html</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021</pubDate>
<description>How to use content blockers to make StackOverflow load insanely fast.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>StackOverflow is a blessing. It's a career maker and a career saver for almost every software engineer I know, myself included. That said, it can be better.</p>

<p><img src='https://ronitray.xyz/img/good-better.webp' alt='Pedro Pascal&#39;s character in Wonder Woman 1984, Maxwell Lord, saying StackOverflow is Good... But it can be Better!'/></p>

<p>The vast majority of StackOverflow usage at work, at least for me, is looking for solutions that exist already. I don't need the account features (it has been months since I've logged in). I land on the question's page from my search engine, and bounce when I am done. I am only concerned with the content of the question and the proposed solutions, and perhaps any similar questions that might be relevant. Along with these, however, this is everything a StackOverflow page presents:</p>

<ol>
<li>A header with a search box I don't use, and links to 'About', 'Products', 'For Teams' and account-related actions.</li>
<li>A form to answer the question.</li>
<li>A link to the developer survey.</li>
<li>A footer with a whole lot of other stuff.</li>
<li>Cookie pop-ups.</li>
<li>Another popup at the bottom urging you to join StackOverflow.</li>
<li>An ad for StackOverflow for Teams in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Options to search for Jobs and Companies in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Links to the general Questions, Users, and Tags pages in the left sidebar.</li>
<li>Links to posts on the StackOverflow blog.</li>
<li>"Hot network questions" from across the StackExchange forums.</li>
</ol>

<p>The average StackOverflow page looks like this:</p>

<p><img src='https://ronitray.xyz/img/full-stackoverflow.webp' alt='A full StackOverflow page'/></p>

<p>Here's how you can strip away the extraneous elements and keep only the content.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>. Most people have this installed already. If you don't, what are you waiting for? It makes the web much less hostile.</p>

<p>Aside from its excellent ad and tracker blocking, uBlock Origin has a powerful feature called cosmetic filtering. This allows you to change the appearance of a website at will. You could render a website in a dark theme, or with any CSS of your choosing. Or better, in this case, you will purge (the official term is 'zap') any DOM elements you don't want to see on the page. Here's how.</p></li>
<li><p>After installing uBlock, click on the settings icon <img src='https://ronitray.xyz/img/ublock_settings.png' alt='The icon for settings in uBlock Origin'></p></li>
<li>In the tab that opens, click on My Filters on the top bar.</li>
<li><p>Add the following lines to the text box:</p>

<pre class='codeblock'>! 2021-06-07 https://stackoverflow.com

</pre></li>
<li><p>Click on 'Apply Changes', close the tab and try opening any StackOverflow page.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is the result:
<img src='https://ronitray.xyz/img/clean-stackoverflow.webp' alt='The new, improved, cleaner StackOverflow page'/></p>

<p>It is much cleaner, shows only the relevant information and offers no distractions whatsoever. Troubleshooting your code has never been more pleasurable.</p>

<title>Lancelot- My Brainchild (a short story I wrote 10 years ago)</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/lancelot.html</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021</pubDate>
<description>You know, I'm somewhat of a writer myself. Not.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Quick note: While rummaging through some old boxes, I found a notebook from years ago. In it, among a host of other terrible essays, was this little short story that I had written when I was maybe 11 or 12 years old. I'm putting it up here as a bit of fun, and for archival purposes. I don't even want to begin to get into the technical and factual inaccuracies or the ridiculous prose, but reader, if you find yourself wondering "what a fucking sociopath this kid is", know that you're not alone.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Finally! I had done it. After a year of loose ends, syntax errors, and broken circuits, I had finally developed my own robot!</p>

<p>Proud isn't quite the word to describe how I felt for my robot, having built it from scratch using e-waste meticulously collected from my neighbors. What really clinched it for me, however, was that I had not programmed him in any conventional programming language. C? Java? None of that. This bad boy was powered by LIMBO, a stable, secure and clean language that was easier on the eye and the silicon than any clunky old platform.</p>

<p>I had decided to call my robot Lancelot, after the bravest of the Knights of the Round Table. The brains that came with this beauty were actually the integrated circuitry and 32-bit architecture of my dear Acer TravelMate 2310 laptop. One year. After one entire year, I managed to pupt the last piece in place. Was it really done?</p>

<p>I flicked Lancelot's "ON" switch, and to my surprise and delight, he immediately burst to life!</p>

<pre><code>"Hello, master. Lancelot is at your service."
</code></pre>

<p>Finally. I had tried to fit in with my fellow humans for years, but instead of friendship, compassion, and support, I received ridicule and pain. Society was never quite tolerant towards me, a textbook genius with a 180 IQ, but can you really blame them? Thankfully, my days of begging for companionship were at an end. Lancelot was now here. My best friend, my creation, my vision.</p>

<p>There was nothing Lancelot couldn't do. Remotely controlling all electronic devices in the house, to cooking and multiplayer gaming, the state of the art mutation algorithm I'd baked in allowed hhim to learn anything under the sun. Siri? Take a back seat. Lancelot's natural understanding of commands was second to none, and he could hold conversation in 20 different languages just by spending a day online. I'd shout out whatever I want, and see them materialize right before my eyes.</p>

<p>Life was so good. I felt like Asimov and Clarke too had been waiting for this day, counting down to it in books that had been my companions when no one else would. Even though my paranoid mother initially was scared of Lance, she soon began to understand the value he added to all our lives, especially mine. Lancelot was officially a member of the family.</p>

<p>Until one fateful day. I remember it like it was yesterday. On the 12th of June, 2024, I was woken, not by the chirpy computerized voice I was so used to hearing, but by screams I didn't immediately recognize. I ran out to discover Mrs. Sinha, our next-door neighbor, in a fit of tears, screaming herself hoarse. On my asking what happened, she snapped at me viciously, "GET AWAY from me, and if you or that... MONSTER you have created ever touch my child again, I WILL REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE!" I then noticed that her son had six long scratches across his back. He had lost a lot of blood...Lance? Yes, I had given him six fingers. But why?</p>

<p>Shocked, I shouted, "LANCELOT! REPORT HERE IMMEDIATELY". There he was, in an instant. </p>

<pre><code>"Yes, sir?"
</code></pre>

<p>"Did you touch Balram Sinha?"</p>

<pre><code>"I did what was necessary."
</code></pre>

<p>"What was necessary?"</p>

<pre><code>"Yes."
</code></pre>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<pre><code>"They hurt you, and they are inferior. Must cleanse the earth of lesser beings."
</code></pre>

<p>And he spun over into the kitchen, leaving me sitting in shock.</p>

<p>It has been a week since then, perhaps the worst of my life. Four dogs in our neighborhood were found dead, with similar marks on their bodies. Lance would go missing for hours on end, and return stained with blood. Afraid of what my parents might do if they found out, I had to sneak him into the yard and hose him down, listening to his unhinged "cleanse the earth to make a better world for you and me" rants get worse every single day.</p>

<p>He left me no choice. But how could I? Had I unknowingly programmed my hate, my revulsion into him? Or was this what the world truly was? I had never stopped to care about others for a second, but I had always thought I wouldn't need to. I would leave them alone, the way they had left me. And live would go on. Lance's escapades make me question this mindset every single day. Really, though, how could I? Not only had I programmed him to be unhackable, his time alive and connected to the cyberspace meant he was now more advanced than I could ever make him. A remote power-off was out of the question. My parents weren't as stupid as I imagined either, and neither were the neighbors. My choice was clear- I had to betray the only thing I have ever loved.</p>

<p>It was final, then. i took him to my room, and before he could say a thing, I bashed in the circuitry I had spent so long collecting, integrating, soldering and programming. He didn't suspect me for a second; although his intelligence was unbound, his faith in me was unwavering. Lancelot was gone forever.</p>

<p>Tears come to my eyes even as I recount it now. Knowing I'm returning to an empty home, friendless again. My father's view was "good riddance to bad rubbish". He never did approve, but maybe his casual indifference was better than my uncritical excitement. I turn the doorknob, and hear a weird buzz from my workbench across the room.</p>

<p>Lancelot's severed head, which I was quite sure I had left at the dumpster, buzzed to life.</p>

<title>GoatCounter- Simple, Tracking-Free Analytics</title>
<link>https://ronitray.xyz/posts/goatcounter.html</link>
<pubDate>Sun, 09 May 2021</pubDate>
<description>Basic analytics, without any reliance on money-hungry ad networks, and without any tracking or privacy encroachment.</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like the idea of analytics. I don't think it's a bad thing to know which posts of yours are getting traction, what your readers would like to read, and so on. I am, however, staunchly pro-privacy. I will not stand for any analytics or telemetry: </p>

<ol>
<li>whose purpose goes beyond introspection</li>
<li>which is used for collecting personally identifiable information</li>
<li>which is used to profile users</li>
<li>which is used to drive ad networks or sell collected data</li>
<li>which is heavy and increases the size (and therefore the loading time) of a website.</li>
</ol>

<p>This, for obvious reasons, rules out the likes of some of the most popular analytics tools like Google and Facebook Analytics. I like the idea of analytics, but refuse to sell my soul or the visitors on my website for it. Thankfully, I don't have to.</p>

<p><a href="https://goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> is a great minimal, <a href="https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter/">open-source</a> web analytics tool. It collects a minimal amount of data and does not link it to identities of users in any way. One of their <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/why">stated goals</a> is to <em>just “count events” rather than “get as much data as technically possible”</em> which works for me.</p>

<p>Like Google Analytics and many top providers, GoatCounter can be integrated with your site using a single line of JavaScript. This adds about 3.5kB of extra data to every page, which is fairly small. However, one of <a href="https://ronitray.xyz/posts/site-look">my own stated goals</a> for this site was to completely forgo JavaScript, or at least hold off on using it unless absolutely necessary. I don't believe analytics is a good enough reason to serve JavaScript, and would perhaps have reconsidered using Goat if that was the only option. Thankfully, it is not. They allow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sending data from server logfiles- A viable option if you are self-hosting or using a VPS, but I am not.</li>
<li>API requests from middleware or app backend.</li>
<li>Tracking Pixel- This is what I use. A 1x1 GIF added to every page that works without JavaScript. It is a leaner solution too, since it adds less than 500 bytes (yes, bytes) to each page. That is a 85% load reduction to something that was already a very small size. The way this works is with an image tag:</li>
</ol>

<pre class="codeblock">
<code>&#x3C;img src=&#x22;https://[USERNAME].goatcounter.com/count?p=/[PAGE_NAME]&#x22;&#x3E;</code>
</pre>

<p>Where [USERNAME] is your GoatCounter username and [PAGE_NAME] is the name of your page that will show up on your analytics dashboard.</p>

<p>I want to be very transparent with this, so this is all the data GoatCounter collects for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>User Agent: To see which browser and/or devices people access the site from</li>
<li>Country and Region: Just to get an idea of the demographic makeup of my audience</li>
<li>Session: Only to eliminate duplicate pageviews. The cited example on their site is: <em>Track unique visitors for up to 8 hours; if you disable this then someone pressing e.g. F5 to reload the page will just show as 2 pageviews instead of 1</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If this is still too invasive for you, you are likely using an adblocker of some sort. I have noticed that most ad-blockers (uBlock Origin, Adguard, StevenBlack hosts list etc.) are tuned to block any requests to or content loaded from GoatCounter, so this will not be an issue for you. You can also block this manually using a hosts file, for example.</p>

<p>Also in the interest of full transparency, I am opening up my analytics dashboard to the general public. You get to see all the data that I do, with no exceptions.</p>
